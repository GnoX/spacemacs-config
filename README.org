* GnoX spacemacs layers and configs

This is my spacemacs configuration, it won't probably work on your system since
there are some hard-coded paths and encrypted secrets.

Clone the repo =git clone https://github.com/GnoX/spacemacs-config.git ~/.emacs.d/private=

The ~.spacemacs~ is intended to be symlinked into home folder.

#+begin_src sh
ln -s ~/emacs.d/private/.spacemacs ~/.spacemacs
#+end_src
